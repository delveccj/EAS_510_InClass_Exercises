# 🏈 NFL Decision Tree Analysis

An engaging in-class exercise that teaches decision tree concepts using real NFL game data.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

Students will learn to:
- Build and interpret decision trees with real-world data
- Understand feature importance and splitting criteria
- Recognize overfitting patterns and regularization effects
- Apply machine learning to sports analytics

## 📊 Dataset Features

The model predicts **game outcomes (Win/Loss)** based on:
- **Home field advantage** (binary)
- **Total offensive yards** (continuous)
- **Ball security** (turnovers, lower is better)
- **Team discipline** (penalty yards, lower is better)
- **Passing yards** (continuous)
- **Rushing yards** (continuous)

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the analysis:**
   ```bash
   python nfl_decision_tree.py
   ```

## 📈 What the Code Does

1. **Loads NFL 2024 data** (or creates synthetic data if API unavailable)
2. **Engineers meaningful features** from raw game statistics
3. **Trains decision tree** with optimal depth to avoid overfitting
4. **Visualizes the tree structure** showing decision rules
5. **Analyzes feature importance** to understand what drives wins
6. **Compares different tree depths** to demonstrate overfitting
7. **Makes predictions** for hypothetical game scenarios

## 🎓 Teaching Flow

### Part 1: Concept Introduction (10 min)
- Run the basic analysis to show the tree
- Discuss how splits like "total_offense > 350 yards" make intuitive sense
- Connect to students' football knowledge

### Part 2: Hands-On Exploration (15 min)
- Have students modify the `predict_game()` parameters
- Ask: "What happens if a team has great offense but many turnovers?"
- Let them experiment with different scenarios

### Part 3: Advanced Concepts (10 min)
- Show the overfitting analysis with different tree depths
- Discuss the bias-variance tradeoff in context they understand
- Connect back to regularization concepts

## 🔍 Key Insights for Discussion

1. **Interpretability**: Students can explain why the tree makes each decision
2. **Feature Engineering**: How raw stats become meaningful predictors
3. **Overfitting**: When trees become too specific to training data
4. **Real-world Application**: How sports teams actually use these methods

## 🛠️ Customization Options

- **Change season**: Modify `season=2024` to analyze different years
- **Add features**: Include weather, injuries, or advanced metrics
- **Different sports**: Adapt the framework for basketball, baseball, etc.
- **Classification vs Regression**: Predict point differential instead of win/loss
